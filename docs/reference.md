# Deepracer-for-Cloud Reference

## Environment Variables

The scripts assume that two files `system.env` containing constant configuration values and  `run.env` with run specific values is populated with the required values. Which values go into which file is not really important.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DR_RUN_ID` | Used if you have multiple independent training jobs only a single DRfC instance. This is an advanced configuration and generally you should just leave this as the default `0`.|
| `DR_WORLD_NAME` | Defines the track to be used.|
| `DR_RACE_TYPE` | Valid options are `TIME_TRIAL`, `OBJECT_AVOIDANCE`, and `HEAD_TO_BOT`.|
| `DR_CAR_COLOR` | Valid options are `Black`, `Grey`, `Blue`, `Red`, `Orange`, `White`, and `Purple`.|
| `DR_CAR_NAME` | Display name of car; shows in Deepracer Console when uploading.|
| `DR_ENABLE_DOMAIN_RANDOMIZATION` | If `True`, this cycles through different environment colors and lighting each episode.  This is typically used to make your model more robust and generalized instead of tightly aligned with the simulator|
| `DR_UPLOAD_S3_PREFIX` | Prefix of the target location. (Typically starts with `DeepRacer-SageMaker-RoboMaker-comm-`|
| `DR_EVAL_NUMBER_OF_TRIALS` | How many laps to complete for evaluation simulations.|
| `DR_EVAL_IS_CONTINUOUS` | If False, your evaluation trial will end if you car goes off track or is in a collision. If True, your car will take the penalty times as configured in those parameters, but continue evaluating the trial.|
| `DR_EVAL_OFF_TRACK_PENALTY` | Number of seconds penalty time added for an off track during evaluation.  Only takes effect if `DR_EVAL_IS_CONTINUOUS` is set to True.|
| `DR_EVAL_COLLISION_PENALTY` | Number of seconds penalty time added for a collision during evaluation.  Only takes effect if `DR_EVAL_IS_CONTINUOUS` is set to True.|
| `DR_EVAL_SAVE_MP4` | Set to `True` to save MP4 of an evaluation run. |
| `DR_TRAIN_CHANGE_START_POSITION` | Determines if the racer shall round-robin the starting position during training sessions. (Recommended to be `True` for initial training.)|
| `DR_TRAIN_ALTERNATE_DRIVING_DIRECTION` | `True` or `False`.  If `True`, the car will alternate driving between clockwise and counter-clockwise each episode.|
| `DR_TRAIN_START_POSITION_OFFSET` | Used to control where to start the training from on first episode.|
| `DR_TRAIN_ROUND_ROBIN_ADVANCE_DISTANCE` | How far to progress each episode in round robin.  0.05 is 5% of the track.  Generally best to try and keep this to even numbers that match with your total number of episodes to allow for even distribution around the track.  For example, if 20 episodes per iternation, .05 or .10 or .20  would be good.|
| `DR_TRAIN_MULTI_CONFIG` | `True` or `False`.  This is used if you want to use different run.env configurations for each worker in a multi worker training run.  See multi config documentation for more details on how to set this up.|
| `DR_TRAIN_MIN_EVAL_TRIALS` | The minimum number of evaluation trials run between each training iteration.  Evaluations will continue as long as policy training is occuring and may be more than this number.  This establishes the minimum, and is generally useful if you want to speed up training especially when using gpu sagemaker containers.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_PRETRAINED` | Determines if training or evaluation shall be based on the model created in a previous session, held in `s3://{DR_LOCAL_S3_BUCKET}/{LOCAL_S3_PRETRAINED_PREFIX}`, accessible by credentials held in profile `{DR_LOCAL_S3_PROFILE}`.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_PRETRAINED_PREFIX` | Prefix of pretrained model within S3 bucket.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_MODEL_PREFIX` | Prefix of model within S3 bucket.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_BUCKET` | Name of S3 bucket which will be used during the session.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_CUSTOM_FILES_PREFIX` | Prefix of configuration files within S3 bucket.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_TRAINING_PARAMS_FILE` | Name of YAML file that holds parameters sent to robomaker container for configuration during training. Filename is relative to `s3://{DR_LOCAL_S3_BUCKET}/{LOCAL_S3_PRETRAINED_PREFIX}`.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_EVAL_PARAMS_FILE` | Name of YAML file that holds parameters sent to robomaker container for configuration during evaluations.  Filename is relative to `s3://{DR_LOCAL_S3_BUCKET}/{LOCAL_S3_PRETRAINED_PREFIX}`.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_MODEL_METADATA_KEY` | Location where the `model_metadata.json` file is stored.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_HYPERPARAMETERS_KEY` | Location where the `hyperparameters.json` file is stored.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_REWARD_KEY` | Location where the `reward_function.py` file is stored.|
| `DR_LOCAL_S3_METRICS_PREFIX` | Location where the metrics will be stored.|
| `DR_OA_NUMBER_OF_OBSTACLES` | For Object Avoidance, the number of obstacles on the track.|
| `DR_OA_MIN_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_OBSTACLES` | Minimum distance in meters between obstacles.|
| `DR_OA_RANDOMIZE_OBSTACLE_LOCATIONS` | If True, obstacle locations will randomly change after each episode.|
| `DR_OA_IS_OBSTACLE_BOT_CAR` | If True, obstacles will appear as a stationary car instead of a box.|
| `DR_OA_OBJECT_POSITIONS` | Positions of boxes on the track. Tuples consisting of progress (fraction [0..1]) and inside or outside lane (-1 or 1). Example: `"0.23,-1;0.46,1"`|
| `DR_H2B_IS_LANE_CHANGE` | If True, bot cars will change lanes based on configuration.|

| `DR_H2B_UPPER_LANE_CHANGE_TIME` | Maximum time in seconds before car will change langes.|
| `DR_H2B_LANE_CHANGE_DISTANCE` | Distance in meters how long it will take the car to change lanes.|
| `DR_H2B_NUMBER_OF_BOT_CARS` | Number of bot cars on the track.|
