# GPU Accelerated OpenGL for Robomaker

One way to improve performance, especially of Robomaker, is to enable GPU-accelerated OpenGL. OpenGL can significantly improve Gazebo performance, even where the GPU does not have enough GPU RAM, or is too old, to support Tensorflow.

## Desktop 

On a Ubuntu desktop running Unity there are hardly any additional steps required.

* Ensure that a recent Nvidia driver is installed and is running.
* Ensure that nvidia-docker is installed; review `bin/prepare.sh` for steps if you do not want to directly run the script.
* Configure DRfC using the following settings in `system.env`:
    * `DR_HOST_X=True`; uses the local X server rather than starting one within the docker container.
    * `DR_DISPLAY`; set to the value of your running X server, if not set then `DISPLAY` will be used.

Before running `dr-start-training`/`dr-start-evaluation` ensure that `DR_DISPLAY`/`DISPLAY` and `XAUTHORITY` are defined.

Check that OpenGL is working by looking for `gzserver` in `nvidia-smi`.

If `DR_GUI_ENABLE=True` then the Gazebo UI, rviz and rqt will open up in separate windows. (With multiple workers it can get crowded...)

### Remote connection to Desktop 

If you want to start training or evaluation via SSH (e.g. to increment the training whilst you are on the go) there are a few steps to do:
* Ensure that you are actually logged in to the local machine (desktop session is running).
* In the SSH terminal:
    * Ensure `DR_DISPLAY` is configured in `system.env`. Otherwise run `export DISPLAY=:1`. [*]
    * Run `export XAUTHORITY=/run/user/$(id -u)/gdm/Xauthority` to let X know where the X magic cookie is.
    * Run `source bin/activate.sh` as normal.
    * Run your `dr-start-training` or `dr-start-evaluation` command. 

*Remark*: Setting `DISPLAY` will lead to certain commands (e.g. `dr-logs-sagemaker`) starting in a terminal window on the desktop, rather than the output being showhn in the SSH terminal.
Use of `DR_DISPLAY` is recommended to avoid this.

## Headless Server

Also a headless server with a GPU, e.g. an EC2 instance, or a local computer with a displayless GPU (e.g. Tesla K40, K80, M40).

This also applies for a desktop computer where you are not logged in. In this case also disconnect any monitor cables to avoid conflict.

* Ensure that a Nvidia driver and nvidia-docker is installed; review `bin/prepare.sh` for steps if you do not want to directly run the script.
* Setup an X-server on the host. `utils/setup-xorg.sh` is a basic installation script.
* Configure DRfC using the following settings in `system.env`:
    * `DR_HOST_X=True`; uses the local X server rather than starting one within the docker container.
    * `DR_DISPLAY`; the X display that the headless X server will start on. (Default is `:99`, avoid using `:0` or `:1` as it may conflict with other X servers.)

Start up the X server with `utils/start-xorg.sh`. 

If `DR_GUI_ENABLE=True` then a VNC server will be started on port 5900 so that you can connect and interact with the Gazebo UI.

Check that OpenGL is working by looking for `gzserver` in `nvidia-smi`.

## WSL2 on Windows 11

OpenGL is also supported in WSL2 on Windows 11. By default an Xwayland server is started in Ubuntu 22.04.

To enable OpenGL acceleration perform the following steps:
* Install x11-server-utils with `sudo apt install x11-server-utils`.
* Configure DRfC using the following settings in `system.env`:
    * `DR_HOST_X=True`; uses the local X server rather than starting one within the docker container.
    * `DR_DISPLAY=:0`; the Xwayland starts on :0 by default.

If you want to interact with the Gazebo UI, set `DR_DOCKER_STYLE=compose` and `DR_GUI_ENABLE=True` in `system.env`.
